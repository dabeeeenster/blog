I started a Web Development Agency in 2002 with [@matte8000](https://twitter.com/matte8000). We now build startups; for ourselves and for other people.

## In the Oven

Spending most of my time on this stuff...

### [DugOut FC](https://www.dugoutfc.com)

Real Fantasy Football. We loved Fantasy Football but though current efforts were sort of rubbish, so we built this.

Launches Summer 2015.

### [Receivr](https://www.receivr.io)

Uber, but with receptionists. You know; telephones and stuff.
