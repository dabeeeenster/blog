I started a Web Development Agency in 2002 with [@matte8000](https://twitter.com/matte8000). We now build startups; for ourselves and for other people.

## In the Oven

Spending most of my work time on this stuff at the moment...

### [DugOut FC](https://www.dugoutfc.com)

Real Fantasy Football. We love Fantasy Football but thought current efforts were sort of rubbish, so we built this.

Launches Summer 2015.

### [Receivr](https://www.receivr.io)

Uber, but with receptionists. You know; telephones and stuff.

### [GetVape](https://www.getvape.co.uk)

It's like smoking. But with water.

## On the stove

Some, none or maybe all of these companies are still trading.
