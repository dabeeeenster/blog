So I thought I might start blogging again, stimulated by the superb words from my friend [Josh](http://joshsummers.co.uk/). My old blog that ran from 2002 was long gone, but its memories remain thanks to the amazing work of the [Internet Archive - check it out](https://web.archive.org/web/20040514053344/http://www.dabeeeenster.com/).

Anyway it was great that I could still read all the rubbish that I had been spouting 10 years ago even though all that hosting and whatnot was long gone. But it got me thinking about how I was using my blog at the time, and what it means for today. 2002. Think back. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were all twinklings in the eyes of the millenials that spawned them, but I was pretty much using my blog as a surrogate. This I now realise; at the time I as blissfully unaware.

If you had told someone in 2002 that you had a blog, they would sort of take a 6 inch step back and mentally reassess your entire personage. Now it's weird if you *aren't* prominent on at least one major social network.

Obviously Twitter and Instagram now seem blindingly obvious, even cliched, but in 2002 we had no smartphones (well, there was [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Gage_(device)), and no mobile data coverage worth talking about. It seems fairly self evident that smartphones really accelerated those sorts of services. But nevertheless, I clearly had photos, thoughts, locations and updates that I felt necessary to share with the world (aka my parents and pretty much no one else) so there were some *signals* that I might have latched onto

So now I'm thinking about what sort of stuff I'm doing right now, that's kind of unusual or weird or painful to get set up, that will become the Twitter of 2019 or the Instagram of 2021. I would expect that there is at least one technology iteration between now and then that will act as an enabler for these services, but I have no doubt that they already exist as rumbles of ideas, needs, wants and desires in my brain. It's just a matter of seeking them out.

I'm very much looking forward to reading this post in 2021, projected onto my retina via Google Glass version 7, and shouting at myself "IT WAS FUCKING OBVIOUS! YOU MISSED IT AGAIN, YOU COMPLETE DICK. ALL YOU NEEDED TO DO WAS..."

Maybe the thing will be blogging, and it will just take a different form. That would piss me off.
